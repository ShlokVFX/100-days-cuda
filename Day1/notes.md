Summary : Used CUDA to add two arrays in parallel, with each thread handling one pair of values.

Learned:

 How to write a basic CUDA kernel.
 How threads, blocks, and grids work in CUDA.
 How to manage GPU memory with cudaMalloc, cudaMemcpy, and cudaFree.

 Resource - I followed a CUDA course on YouTube from freeCodeCamp.
