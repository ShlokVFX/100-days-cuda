# 100-Days-of-Learning-CUDA-Kernels-
A deep dive into GPU programming and parallel computing  This repository documents my 100-day journey of learning and writing CUDA kernels. The goal is to explore GPU acceleration, optimize parallel computations, and gain hands-on experience with CUDA for high-performance computing.

Day 1:

Summary : Used CUDA to add two arrays in parallel, with each thread handling one pair of values.

Learned:

 How to write a basic CUDA kernel.
 How threads, blocks, and grids work in CUDA.
 How to manage GPU memory with cudaMalloc, cudaMemcpy, and cudaFree.

 Resource - I followed a CUDA course on YouTube from freeCodeCamp.
