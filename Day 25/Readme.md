## **CUDA and GPU Architecture**

### 1. Explain how the L1TEX cache combines texture and data caching. How does this affect occupancy? 

**Answer:**  
- **Unified Cache:** On NVIDIA GPUs, the L1TEX cache is a unified cache that serves both texture and data (global memory) requests. It means that the same cache hardware is used for reading texture data as well as regular load/store operations.
- **Caching Policy:** Texture caching often involves spatial locality optimizations (e.g., prefetching neighboring pixels) and can tolerate some divergence, while data caching aims at reducing latency for standard memory accesses. The unified design enables reuse of data that might be used for both purposes.
- **Impact on Occupancy:**  
  - **Positive Impact:** Efficient caching reduces memory latency, which can allow warps to spend less time waiting for data. This helps keep the compute pipelines busy and can indirectly improve occupancy.
  - **Negative Impact:** However, if the access patterns are irregular or if the working set is too large, contention in the L1TEX cache can lead to cache thrashing. This increases memory latency and may force threads to stall, reducing the effective occupancy.
- **Key Consideration:** Achieving high occupancy depends not only on the number of active warps but also on how quickly those warps can execute instructions. An efficiently utilized L1TEX cache improves throughput without necessarily changing the theoretical occupancy.

### 2. Implement a tiled matrix multiplication kernel with shared memory. How does tile size affect performance?

**Example Implementation:**
```cpp
#define TILE_SIZE 32

__global__ void tiledMatMul(float *A, float *B, float *C, int N) {
    __shared__ float tileA[TILE_SIZE][TILE_SIZE];
    __shared__ float tileB[TILE_SIZE][TILE_SIZE];

    int row = blockIdx.y * TILE_SIZE + threadIdx.y;
    int col = blockIdx.x * TILE_SIZE + threadIdx.x;
    float sum = 0.0f;

    for (int t = 0; t < (N + TILE_SIZE - 1) / TILE_SIZE; t++) {
        if (row < N && (t * TILE_SIZE + threadIdx.x) < N)
            tileA[threadIdx.y][threadIdx.x] = A[row * N + t * TILE_SIZE + threadIdx.x];
        else
            tileA[threadIdx.y][threadIdx.x] = 0.0f;
        if (col < N && (t * TILE_SIZE + threadIdx.y) < N)
            tileB[threadIdx.y][threadIdx.x] = B[(t * TILE_SIZE + threadIdx.y) * N + col];
        else
            tileB[threadIdx.y][threadIdx.x] = 0.0f;
        __syncthreads();
        
        for (int k = 0; k < TILE_SIZE; k++)
            sum += tileA[threadIdx.y][k] * tileB[k][threadIdx.x];
        __syncthreads();
    }
    
    if (row < N && col < N)
        C[row * N + col] = sum;
}
```

**How Tile Size Affects Performance:**
- **Data Reuse:** A larger tile increases the amount of data reused from shared memory, reducing global memory traffic.  
- **Shared Memory Constraints:** However, larger tiles use more shared memory per block, which can limit the number of concurrent blocks per SM and reduce occupancy.  
- **Memory Coalescing:** Optimal tile sizes help ensure that memory accesses are coalesced; if too small, the overhead of loading tiles may dominate.
- **Balance:** The optimal tile size balances maximizing data reuse and keeping shared memory usage and register pressure within limits, thereby maintaining high occupancy.

## **Profiling Tools**

### 3. Compare Nsight Systems and Nsight Compute. When would you use each?

**Answer:**
- **Nsight Systems:**  
  - **Scope:** System-level profiler that provides a holistic view of application behavior, including CPU–GPU interactions, OS-level events, kernel launches, and memory transfers.
  - **Usage:** Use it when diagnosing end-to-end performance issues, understanding concurrency between host and device, and identifying bottlenecks in the overall workflow.
- **Nsight Compute:**  
  - **Scope:** Kernel-level profiler focused on detailed GPU hardware metrics such as occupancy, memory throughput, instruction mix, and stall reasons.
  - **Usage:** Use it for deep dives into the performance of individual kernels—when you need to optimize kernel code or understand specific hardware utilization details.
  
*In summary, Nsight Systems is ideal for overall application profiling, while Nsight Compute is best for low-level kernel optimization.*

### 4. What metrics would you track to diagnose poor L2 cache hit rates?

**Answer:**
- **L2 Hit Rate / Miss Rate:** Direct metrics showing the percentage of accesses that hit or miss in the L2 cache.
- **Global Memory Throughput:** If the L2 hit rate is low, you might see increased global memory traffic.
- **Memory Transactions:** Look at metrics like global load/store transactions per warp.
- **Cache Bandwidth Utilization:** Indicates if the L2 cache is effectively reducing latency.
- **Latency Metrics:** Compare memory access latencies with expected L2 and DRAM latencies.
- **Uncoalesced Accesses:** Metrics on coalescing can hint that poor access patterns are reducing L2 effectiveness.

## **System-Level Debugging**

### 5. A CUDA application hangs intermittently. How would you trace GPU/CPU synchronization issues?

**Answer:**
- **Nsight Systems:** Use it to view the timeline of kernel launches, data transfers, and CPU thread activities. Look for long idle periods or misaligned synchronization points.
- **CUDA Events:** Insert CUDA events (`cudaEventRecord`, `cudaEventSynchronize`) to measure the time taken for kernels and transfers, pinpointing delays.
- **cudaDeviceSynchronize() Checks:** Wrap kernel launches with error checking immediately after `cudaDeviceSynchronize()` to catch synchronization issues.
- **cuda-gdb:** Step through the code to check where the hang occurs.
- **Compute Sanitizer:** Run with race detection tools to find potential race conditions affecting synchronization.

### 6. Explain how CUDA streams and events facilitate overlapping computation and data transfers.

**Answer:**
- **CUDA Streams:**  
  - Allow you to queue operations (kernels, memory copies) that can run concurrently on the GPU if they belong to different streams.  
  - By assigning different work to different streams, data transfers can be overlapped with kernel execution.
- **CUDA Events:**  
  - Serve as markers or timestamps within a stream.
  - You can record an event after a data transfer and then have a kernel wait for that event, effectively synchronizing operations within or across streams.
- **Combined Effect:**  
  - Together, streams and events enable asynchronous operations. For example, while one stream is transferring data, another stream can run a kernel, thereby hiding data transfer latency and increasing overall throughput.

## **Performance Optimization**

### 7. A kernel’s warp execution efficiency is 60%. What factors could contribute to this?

**Answer:**
- **Warp Divergence:** Conditional branches that cause threads within a warp to follow different execution paths.
- **Uncoalesced Memory Access:** Inefficient global memory access patterns that force some threads to stall.
- **Load Imbalance:** Variability in work distribution within a warp.
- **Instruction Dependencies:** Data dependencies that create pipeline stalls.
- **Excessive Synchronization:** Unnecessary barriers or synchronization calls within the kernel.
- **Resource Contention:** High register or shared memory usage that limits the number of active warps.

### 8. How does increasing block size affect register pressure and occupancy?

**Answer:**
- **Register Pressure:**  
  - A larger block size means more threads per block. If each thread uses a substantial number of registers, the total register demand per block increases.
  - Exceeding the available registers per SM can force the compiler to spill registers to local memory, which significantly slows down execution.
- **Occupancy:**  
  - Occupancy is the ratio of active warps to the maximum number of warps that can be resident on an SM.
  - While a larger block size can increase the number of threads per block (potentially increasing occupancy), if register usage (or shared memory usage) becomes too high, it limits the number of blocks that can run concurrently on an SM.
  - Therefore, there's a trade-off: increasing block size may improve data reuse and reduce overhead per thread, but if it increases register pressure too much, it can lower occupancy.
  

**Behavioral and Design Questions:**

### **1. Describe a project where you resolved a GPU performance bottleneck. What tools/metrics did you use?**

**Answer:**  
“In one project, we were training a deep neural network for real‑time object detection, and the GPU kernel for the convolution layers was underperforming. I suspected that memory throughput and kernel occupancy were the key bottlenecks. I used NVIDIA Nsight Compute and Nsight Systems to drill down into the performance metrics.  



Specifically, I looked at:  
- **Occupancy & Active Warps:** To ensure we were saturating the Streaming Multiprocessors (SMs).  
- **Memory Throughput & Cache Hit Rates:** I tracked L1/L2 cache hit ratios, global memory throughput, and DRAM utilization to check for inefficient memory accesses.  
- **Warp Stall Reasons:** Metrics like warp divergence, execution efficiency, and stall cycles pointed to uncoalesced memory accesses and branch divergence in the convolution kernel.  

Based on these metrics, I restructured the kernel with better tiling, improved shared memory usage, and fused some operations to reduce redundant global memory reads. This led to a 50% improvement in throughput on the convolution layers. Tools like cuda-memcheck also helped verify that there were no hidden memory errors impacting performance.”

### **2. Design a profiling system for distributed training across multiple GPUs. What metrics would you prioritize?**

**Answer:**  
“When designing a profiling system for distributed training, I would build a solution that collects metrics at both the per-GPU and system levels, integrating them into a real‑time dashboard for analysis. Here’s my approach:

1. **Per-GPU Metrics:**  
   - **Kernel-Level Metrics:** Use Nsight Compute to capture occupancy, register usage, memory throughput, cache hit rates (L1/L2), and stall reasons (e.g., due to memory latency or warp divergence).  
   - **Utilization Metrics:** Track SM and overall GPU utilization, active cycles, and idle time.
   - **Memory & Communication:** Monitor DRAM throughput, PCIe/NVLink bandwidth usage, and latency. These are crucial when data transfers between GPUs are a factor.

2. **System-Level Metrics:**  
   - **Iteration Time and Throughput:** Log the time taken per training iteration, end-to-end latency, and mini-batch processing rates.  
   - **Scaling Efficiency:** Measure how well the workload scales as more GPUs are added (e.g., speedup factors, synchronization overhead).
   - **Communication Overhead:** Collect metrics on inter-node and inter-GPU communication latency and throughput.

3. **Tools & Integration:**  
   - **Data Collection:** Use a combination of Nsight Systems for system-wide tracing and custom hooks (e.g., using CUDA events) for kernel timings.
   - **Dashboarding:** Integrate with monitoring systems like Prometheus and Grafana to provide real‑time visualizations and historical trends.
   - **Correlation:** Ensure the system correlates GPU metrics with training metrics (like loss convergence and throughput) to understand the impact of hardware performance on overall training.

By prioritizing these metrics, the profiling system can provide actionable insights—enabling targeted optimizations at both the kernel and the system level to ensure efficient scaling of distributed training.”
