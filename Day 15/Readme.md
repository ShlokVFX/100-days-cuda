# CUDA Graphs

## Introduction
CUDA Graphs provide a mechanism to capture and reuse a sequence of GPU operations, allowing for more efficient execution and reduced overhead. This feature is particularly useful for applications with repetitive workloads.

## Benefits
- **Reduced Overhead**: By capturing a sequence of operations, CUDA Graphs minimize the overhead associated with launching individual kernels.
- **Improved Performance**: Reusing captured graphs can lead to better performance due to optimized execution paths.
- **Simplified Code**: Encapsulating complex sequences of operations into a graph can make the code easier to understand and maintain.

## Basic Concepts
- **Graph**: A collection of nodes representing operations and edges representing dependencies between these operations.
- **Node**: Represents an individual operation, such as a kernel launch, memory copy, or event.
- **Stream Capture**: The process of recording operations into a graph.

## Example
Here is a simple example of using CUDA Graphs:

```cpp
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <iostream>

__global__ void kernel() {
    printf("Hello from the kernel!\n");
}

int main() {
    cudaStream_t stream;
    cudaStreamCreate(&stream);

    cudaGraph_t graph;
    cudaGraphExec_t graphExec;

    cudaStreamBeginCapture(stream, cudaStreamCaptureModeGlobal);

    kernel<<<1, 1, 0, stream>>>();

    cudaStreamEndCapture(stream, &graph);
    cudaGraphInstantiate(&graphExec, graph, NULL, NULL, 0);

    cudaGraphLaunch(graphExec, stream);
    cudaStreamSynchronize(stream);

    cudaGraphExecDestroy(graphExec);
    cudaGraphDestroy(graph);
    cudaStreamDestroy(stream);

    return 0;
}
```

## Conclusion
CUDA Graphs are a powerful feature for optimizing GPU workloads. By capturing and reusing sequences of operations, they can significantly reduce overhead and improve performance.
