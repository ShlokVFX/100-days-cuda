Here's a README message you can use to introduce the concept of the Softmax kernel in your repository:

# Softmax CUDA Kernel

The **Softmax function** is a key operation in machine learning, often used in classification problems, particularly in neural networks. The Softmax function takes a vector of raw scores (logits) as input and converts it into a probability distribution. Each element in the output vector represents the probability of the corresponding class, and the sum of all the probabilities equals 1.

Where:
- \( y_i \) is the output probability for the \(i\)-th class.
- \( z_i \) is the raw score (logit) for the \(i\)-th class.

This transformation ensures that all values in the output vector \( \mathbf{y} \) are in the range [0, 1], making them interpretable as probabilities.

## Softmax CUDA Kernel

This repository includes a CUDA-based implementation of the Softmax function designed to run efficiently on GPUs. By parallelizing the computation across multiple threads, we can significantly accelerate the processing of large vectors (or matrices) of raw scores, making it ideal for deep learning applications.

### Key Features
- **Efficient GPU computation**: Takes advantage of CUDA's parallel execution model to perform Softmax across large datasets.
- **Tensor Core Optimizations**: Implements specialized routines for tensor cores to maximize throughput on modern GPUs.
- **Shared Memory and Warp-level Optimizations**: Utilizes shared memory to minimize global memory accesses and warp-level operations to optimize performance.

This kernel is particularly useful for implementing Softmax in the final layer of neural networks for classification, where it is essential to convert the raw model outputs into probabilities.
